# Readme Notes for CPP Workspace using Eclipse C/C++ IDE along with CUTE

## Instruction
- 'DONOT' change test.cpp that was created as a part of CUTE test project!
- Create a C++ Project
- Select CUTE with MinGW (Do not use Cygwin because it will have a make problems!)
- Make sure to select to include 'header files'
- I decided to organize the src into cpp and test subfolders to separate production code
   and unit tests. I am not quite sure how a typical C++ project handles unit tests. I am 
   doing it manually because that is how I work on Java using JUnit.
